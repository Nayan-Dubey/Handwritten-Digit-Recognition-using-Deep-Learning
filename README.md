🖊 Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning
This project implements Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits (0-9) with high accuracy.
A neural network is made up by stacking layers of neurons, and is defined by the weights 
of connections and biases of neurons. Activations are a result dependent on a certain input.

This structure is known as a feedforward architecture because the connections in the network flow forward from the input layer to the output layer without any feedback loops.
